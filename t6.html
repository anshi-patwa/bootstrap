                In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is
                supposed to continue or grow without external input.
                Many analytical techniques are often called bootstrap
                methods in reference to their self-starting or
                self-supporting implementation, such as bootstrapping in
                statistics, in finance, or in linguistics.
